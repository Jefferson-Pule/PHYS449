## Grading Remarks

## Other Remarks
- Good code structure use of modules however you may want to keep both linear regression functions in a single module
- Inappropriate use of class for Matrix class, just a wrapper for numpy functions with no purpose
- Classes for gradient descent and analytic solution has little utility
-- If you want to include more utility you might want to save the weights and
include a call function for the linear model
